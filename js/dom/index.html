    <h1>JavaScript &gt; DOM</h1>
    Assume you have only native JS functions available.
    <dl class="qz-qa">
        <dt>Find left position of #d element relatively to the body element</dt>
        <dd>
    <xmp>
    // your code
    </xmp>
        </dd>

        <dt>Modify you code to do same calculation for any nesting level of the #d</dt>
        <dd>
    <xmp>
    // I ended up writing code for any level. I had a little bit of trouble remembering how to get left positions
    // using JavaScript and assumed there would be an easy way to just grab its position on screen, but the
    // relative positioning of the parents made it return the CSS left value so it only made sense to loop upwards
    // and add offsets. I did a quick google to see if there was an easier way to do this, but nothing really turned up.

    // It should also be noted that this function makes the assumption that the body is the root element of the page.

    function getLeftPosition(el) {
      var offset = 0;
      while(el != null) {
        offset += el.offsetLeft;
        el = el.offsetParent; 
      }
      return offset;
    }

    var d = document.getElementById("d");
    console.log(getLeftPosition(d)); // offset comes out to 115
    </xmp>
        </dd>
    </dl>
