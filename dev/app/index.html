            How would you build simple TODO app. Describe your choice of techologies and tools: languages, frameworks, testing and deployment.

        I would use the following frameworks/libraries/services: AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, Heroku, PostgreSQL. I'd use SQLite if this
        stayed small (and to keep it really simple), but unfortunately Heroku doesn't like it and if this is going to be web accessible and
        I'll need to deploy, I'm going to opt for Heroku's one-click deploy and just set up the db properly.<br>
        <br>
        Using Angular, I'd use their resource library to integrate with a REST API I'd build in Rails. Rails would pretty much only be there
        for serving JSON. Because it's done in Angular, I might want to use some of their templating to display different views (add new task list might
        load up a <em>different</em> page). I can use a TemplateController or something to serve those files, but really if I wanted to keep it simple,
        I would just make this truly a single page app and do everything inline.<br>
        <br>
        Deployment is simple with Heroku. I might set up a staging server to deploy to first just for a quick sanity check before deploying
        to production, but that might be overkill for an app of this size.<br>
        <br>
        Testing is built into Rails so I'd just use that to ensure my JSON is working properly. Because of the way AngularJS works, it plays nicely
        with unit testing frameworks like Jasmine, so I'd probably just use that.
